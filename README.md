# ObjectDetection
In this model ,I have detected wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants, including wheat datasets from around the globe.Using worldwide data,I have focused on the generalized solution to estimate the number and sizes of wheat heads.To better guage the performance for the unseen genotypes, environments and observational conditions the training dataset covers multiple region.

# Motivation
- Model developed for wheat phenotyping need to be able to generalize between environments.
- If Successful, researchers can accurately estimate the density and size of the wheat heads in different varieties.
- With improved detection farmers can better assess their crops.
